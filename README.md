A simple, clean, and mobile-friendly web application designed to help students learn the United States states and their capitals. This interactive flashcard quiz is perfect for studying on a tablet or computer.

## About The Project

This project was created to provide an easy-to-use study tool for a student's geography homework. It's built with plain HTML, Tailwind CSS for styling, and vanilla JavaScript for the logic, making it lightweight and easy to deploy on services like GitHub Pages.

The application allows users to quiz themselves in three different ways to reinforce their knowledge from multiple angles.

## Features

  - State ➔ Capital
  - Shape ➔ State & Capital
  - Capital ➔ State
- **Interactive Flashcards:** Click or tap a card to flip it and reveal the answer.
- **Regional Focus:** Currently includes the West and Southwest regions of the United States.
- **Shuffle Functionality:** Randomize the order of the cards for a new challenge every time.
- **Responsive Design:** Works great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Future Development

This project is a great starting point, but there's more to do! The immediate next step is to build out the remaining U.S. regions:

- [ ] Midwest
- [ ] Southeast
- [ ] Northeast

This would be a great opportunity for anyone looking to contribute. The process would involve:

- Finding outline images for the states in each region.
- Adding the new state, capital, and image link data to the `stateData` object in the `<script>` section of the `index.html` file.
- Adding a new button for the region in the "Region Selection" section of the HTML.
